How to run the app on web browser:
    1. Install flutter SDK(dart SDK comes with it, so no need to install dart SDK seperately)
    2. Open "flutter_to_do" folder in Visual Studio Code
    3. Install "dart" and "flutter" extensions for Visual Studio Code
    4. Open terminal and enter "flutter run" to run application on web browser
    5. Enter "flutter test" to run tests

If it doesn't run the app or the test, make sure to "cd .\flutter_to_do\", or make sure that flutter and dart are installed properly!
